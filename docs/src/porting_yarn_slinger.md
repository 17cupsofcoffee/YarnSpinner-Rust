# Working Without Bevy

While we currently emphasize the use of the Bevy plugin, Yarn Slinger is a standalone library that can be used with any game engine (or none at all!).

While there is currently no in-depth documentation on this, the [yarn slinger tests](../../crates/yarn_slinger/tests) should point you in the right direction. 
If you want to port Yarn Slinger to another engine, feel free to reach out by [creating an issue](https://github.com/yarn-slinger/yarn-slinger/issues/new)!
