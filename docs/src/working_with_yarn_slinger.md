# Working with Yarn Slinger

Yarn Slinger is a port of the widely used dialogue tool [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev).
They both share the idea of writing dialog in writer-friendly text files called *Yarn files*. We
will take a look at how to write these in the next chapter, [Yarn Files](./working_with_yarn_slinger/yarn_files.md).
