# Working Without Bevy

While we currently emphasize the use of the Bevy plugin, Yarn Spinner for Rust is a standalone library that can be used with any game engine (or none at all!).

While there is currently no in-depth documentation on this, our [test suite](../../crates/yarnspinner/tests) should point you in the right direction. 
If you want to port Yarn Spinner for Rust to another engine, feel free to reach out by [creating an issue](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Rust/issues/new)!
